To ensure everyone can test front-end code smoothly, please follow these steps:

Install Node.js (Version 10 or Higher)

Download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/.

Confirm installation by running node -v in your terminal.

Use WebStorm for Front-End Development, view, testing etc..

Download WebStorm (JetBrainsâ€™ IDE for JavaScript): https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm.

This aligns with JetBrains tools often used for back-end work (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).

Why:

Node.js enables running JavaScript locally.

WebStorm simplifies code editing, testing, and debugging.
